#Quote on New Tab
A Chrome extension that shows a quote, its author and todays day, date and year in the new tab page.  
It uses the [forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to the fetch the quotes and their authors names.  
It changes its font color and background color from black on white to white on black at night to be easy on the eyes.  
It does not shows a new quote until the present quote has been marked as read by being clicked.
