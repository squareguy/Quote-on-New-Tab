#Quote on New Tab
A Chrome extension that shows a quote, its author and todays day, date and year in the new tab page.  
It uses the [forismatic API](http://forismatic.com/en/api/) to the fetch the quotes and their authors names.

It does not shows a new quote until the present quote has been marked as read by being clicked.
